SmartCommandLine
================

A wrapper for the clunky Windows commandline "shell" (let's be honest with ourselves, it's just DOS running in a window). 
I created it to make working with Microsoft's commandline-based checkin/build/test systems less painful (when I worked on the Bing Rewards team as an independent contractor).  

The (never realized) dream of this program would be a split-pane design, in which a Windows-Explorer-like view would always show the list of files in the current working directory. The commandline pane would change directory in response to directory changes enacted with the Explorer-like pane.
